MindFeed 🧠
A psychology discussion board where users can share and explore posts about psychology, dreams and the mind.

Reflection
What requirements did I achieve:
Created a React client with multiple pages using React Router
Built an Express server with GET, POST and DELETE endpoints
Created a form for users to add new posts
Designed a PostgreSQL database schema and seeded it with realistic data
Used SQL to retrieve posts from the database
Displayed all posts using .map()
Used setInterval and useEffect to poll the database every 5 seconds


Stretch goals achieved:
Dynamic single post pages using /posts/:id
Delete functionality on posts


Were there any goals I was unable to achieve?
Like functionality and category filtering were not implemented


What went well?
Setting up the Express server and connecting it to Supabase
Building the Twitter/X style feed UI


What could have gone better?
Could have added more stretch goals like likes and filtering .
